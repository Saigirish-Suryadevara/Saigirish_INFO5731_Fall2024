It was spectacular and made up for all the deficiencies of the 2nd half - and even made the whole movie look brilliant. I rated it 9 here.Then I saw 'The 400 blows'. To sum up my experience:The 400 Blows (+) Dyslexia in place of the existential theme (+) A brother instead of a friend (+) boarding school instead of a military school (+) Silly art competition the expected winner of which is quite obvious (+) One extra hour of film reel wasting (+++) Smugness of Aamir Khan - the messiah, the all seeing prophet, the true leader of all mankind = Taare Zameen ParEvery single detail is a rip off. It's now quite clear why the latter parts of the movie was distinctly average - those were Aamir Khan's additions to the 400 blows! If Aamir Khan's \\\"independent approach to the world of filmmaking,\\\" is a ripping off of the 1950's French new wave films, god bless Indian cinema. Amen.\",\n          \"I understand Mr. Nolan purposely made the dialogue in Interstellar indistinct to achieve some artistic goal. Unfortunately, I, being almost completely deaf, could not understand enough dialogue to even guess what was going on. I can usually get by without close captioning, but in this case, it was impossible. If I had known this going in, I would have opted for a theater with close captioning . . . whoops, this wasn't digital. Sarcasm aside, I guess Mr. Nolan did not think about how his decisions impacted the hearing impaired. I did not vote because it would not be fair to judge the book solely by its cover. I need to see the movie again with closed captioning before I can vote. I hope I didn't spoil this for anyone. Mr Nolan sure spoiled it for me.\",\n          \"Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

To sum up my experience:The 400 Blows (+) Dyslexia in place of the existential theme (+) A brother instead of a friend (+) boarding school instead of a military school (+) Silly art competition the expected winner of which is quite obvious (+) One extra hour of film reel wasting (+++) Smugness of Aamir Khan - the messiah, the all seeing prophet, the true leader of all mankind = Taare Zameen ParEvery single detail is a rip off. It's now quite clear why the latter parts of the movie was distinctly average - those were Aamir Khan's additions to the 400 blows! If Aamir Khan's \\\"independent approach to the world of filmmaking,\\\" is a ripping off of the 1950's French new wave films, god bless Indian cinema. Amen.\",\n          \"I understand Mr. Nolan purposely made the dialogue in Interstellar indistinct to achieve some artistic goal. Unfortunately, I, being almost completely deaf, could not understand enough dialogue to even guess what was going on. I can usually get by without close captioning, but in this case, it was impossible. If I had known this going in, I would have opted for a theater with close captioning . . . whoops, this wasn't digital. Sarcasm aside, I guess Mr. Nolan did not think about how his decisions impacted the hearing impaired. I did not vote because it would not be fair to judge the book solely by its cover. I need to see the movie again with closed captioning before I can vote. I hope I didn't spoil this for anyone. Mr Nolan sure spoiled it for me.\",\n          \"Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
